for AI, if trying to avoid direction ships, you can calculate which way it should go by 
adding up the strength distance values
strength distance for a ship can be strength * 1/distance. This will provide incentives for ships that are trying to get
away from combat to flee in the safest direction possible(so a 3 units up and 4 units to the right with a strnength of 12 to
to make this easy will set a strength distance of 4 for up and 3 for up and 3 for right, enticing the ship to go down as its 
away from the highest number)
